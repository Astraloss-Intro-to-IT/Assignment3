                <h2>Topic:</h2>
                <p>+ Over the last two decades, the world has undergone massive changes; however, there have been few applications or websites developed to assist the disabled. When programmers create a program, they are typically concerned with the profit it will bring, but technology, to me, is a tool for improving people's living conditions. With a strong desire to make the lives of the blind easier, I decided to develop an application with AI support that would act as their second eyes, assisting them in recognizing everything around them. The project will run on both the iOS and Android platforms to reach the greatest number of users possible with the help of virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and so on. 
                  + This application not only helps visually impaired persons have a better day-to-day experience, but it also helps to develop essential technologies that will be used in a billion-dollar industry. Working on this project will provide us with a professional working environment in which we will be able to collaborate with experienced professors and create hundreds of works for others.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                   According to the Visual Impairments and Blindness Global Data & Statistics in 2020 there are around 276 million people worldwide are blind or have moderate or serve vision impairment, among them 205 million visually impaired people are over the age of 50, accounting for 80 percent (Laser eye surgery hub - 2020). Above all, my grandfather is having diabetes which can lead to the complication is visual impairment, so I want to create something to help him and others like him enjoy the world around them without any difficulties. Furthermore, the basic AI system on a cell phone has been developed, so all that is required is an application that connects and controls the AI to do far more than ever before. Indeed, AI is playing an important part in the development of numerous technologies around the world, and it has the potential to be a game changer in many industries such as producing autonomous vehicles, the metaverse, and cyber security. Working on this project will provide me with numerous opportunities to approach professional employers, as my knowledge and abilities in AI development are highly valued in today's large organizations. Not only can my skills and expertise attract professional employers, but this community project can also pique their interest in terms of assistance and investment.

                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <p>
                  In the market, there are now many applications and products are developed already: <br><br>
+ The first one is ‘Be my eyes’ which available on both iOS and Android platform. However, this requires volunteers which means it need real person sitting in front of the camera to support people have visual impaired while they are opening the apps. This necessitates a big volunteer workforce, and they must be available at all times to give critical and timely assistance to users.<br><br>
+ The second one is the lumen glasses; this is the most advanced technology to support visual impairments with 5 cameras, it can detect whole surrounding environment and transfer to the users with both haptic and auditory contact. Although these glasses incorporate a lot of advanced technology, I believe the pricing is out of reach for most people.<br><br>
+ The last one and also our direct rival is ‘Seeing AI’ which developed by Microsoft, this is the most similar one to our project, however this is only developed in iOS which cause inconvenience for users who are not using iPhone. Furthermore, this is only used with the iPhone's Voiceover mode, thus they are not genuinely assisted by the virtual assistance, which cannot provide the appropriate decision like human in various instances and cannot also launch and operate the application using voice.

                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <p>Build a perfect recognition system of objects around us: With AI, machine and deep learning; a recognition system of surrounding objects such as texts, currency, color, description of people and scene will be created.<br><br>
                  + Another support tool for visual impairments: Training a guide dog can cost up to 60,000 dollars, and they cannot readily care for the dog on their own; also, using a walking cane for visual impairments is not always convenient or effective. As a result, our program was created to tackle this fundamental issue; it not only saves them money but also improves their daily activities and living conditions (Mihai-Alexandru Cristea - 23/11/2020). This technology required many resources because we are not only aim to make a solution for the visually impaired, but also a best product, a reliable guardian to aid them in daily life which create opportunities for the blind to live independent and live the way they like with less difficulties. People with visually impaired can be support from the app to help them travel without guidance from others and documents, texts and even the amount of money they paid can be read out loud. Beyond that, it has the potential to launch a revolution in technology development for the disabled, ensuring that no one is left behind in the 4.0 era. <br><br>
                  + Chances to enter billions dollar industry in IT field:  If the initiative succeeds, it will earn us a lot of money from users who purchase the software to serve the further research purposes; in fact, many huge syndicates and specialists want to join our community project, giving us the opportunity to work in a professional environment. This is also fundamental experience for us to develop in the AI, censor and lidar cameras, and the virtual assistant’s technology which can support us to come into many other industries such as developing autonomous vehicles, manufacturing robots and education services.  <br><br>
                  •	Autonomous vehicles: Vehicle sensor technology, such as laser radar or LiDAR systems, is expected to be the new cornerstone of self-driving vehicles. Laser radar works in conjunction with other sensors such as cameras, ultrasonic, and long-range radar to assist cars and trucks in navigating their surroundings. (Ann Neal - Apr 24, 2018) <br><br>
                  
                  •	Robots: in assembly applications, AI is a very important tool. When paired with advanced vision systems, AI can aid in real-time course correction, which is especially beneficial in complicated industrial industries such as aerospace. While in operation, AI can also be utilized to assist a robot in learning on its own which paths are optimal for various procedures (Robotics Online Marketing Team | 09/11/2018). <br><br>
                  
                  •	Educational services: Many blind students struggle with their academics; they seldom catch up with classmates, so their phones might serve as trustworthy allies, reading and delivering information and documents for them. Furthermore, as AI advances, virtual technology can be used in class to make the material more specific and intriguing.

                <h2>Plan and progress</h2>
                <p>
                  + Forming a responsible team<br><br>

                  + In order create these apps, many professionals in various fields are needed, including mechatronics, robotics, industrial design, psychology, business development, and before publishing the application to the community, it must go through numerous tests with many blind individuals in order to deliver the best version (Mihai-Alexandru Cristea - 23/11/2020). This is a revolutionary creation for the blind, so it forces to make no mistakes during the running process because it might be affected to their experience or even their lives. <br><br>
                  
                  + To begin, the app icon will be created by using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The app icon will look like an eye with a human holding a cane inside it to display the specific purpose of this application. 
                  
                  + Then, for Android applications, it must use programming languages such as Java or C++, and for iOS apps, I must use Swift or Object-C to ensure that the greatest number of users can approach (Sandamal Siripathi - Jul 24 2017). Making a basic user interface is critical for the majority of my users, who have visual impairments; yet I must also ensure that it loads quickly and runs smoothly. The application will be pretty basic, with several channels such as currency, text and handwriting, color, and scene surrounding it that can be switched to by both voice and haptic.<br><br>
                  
                  
                  +  I am also knowledgeable about AI development since I must allow the computer system to learn from the simplest to the most complicated data and images in order to recognize, analyze, forecast, and provide final findings as quickly as feasible. It has to understand the environment, objects, their position and movement in 3D. Then, virtual assistants transmit information to the blind using auditory impulses. To guarantee the system functions efficiently and properly, a good picture classification algorithm is designed, which needs a lot of individual and technological processes between the live camera video stream and data (Oction n.d.). To handle the input and output data, this will need extensive backend computing, such as massive database management, memory allocation, and powerful hardware interfacing (Kevin Toth - 16 Jan 2017).<br><br>
                  + Furthermore, because the mobile phone is portable and inseparable, individuals always have it with them; thus, it will now serve as a trustworthy aid for the blinds and visually impaired people.<br><br>
                  
                  + Unlike other apps, users do not need to click on the app's icon or navigate through the user interface; instead, they will instruct the virtual assistant to turn on the app whenever they require it. The app will then connect and turn on their front camera to process data from a video stream in a radius of 1 meter in front of them to warn of impending risks and objects, and the virtual assistance access the microphone to read it out loud for you. Furthermore, it can identify the color, text as well as handwriting in newspapers, documents, determine the value of the money they paid, and human expression. With the development of LIDAR sensors on phones, the measurement of the surrounding environment will be faster and more precise, resulting in the greatest user experience (Jessica Canning - 26 March 2021).<br><br>
                  
                  + The app will initially run with English and Chinese audio readout; however, in order to extend the market, it will be expanded to include many other languages such as Vietnamese, Japanese, and so on.<br><br>
                  
                  + After completing the app, I will solicit feedback from friends and family to delete or add certain adjustments to produce the most user-friendly platforms. Furthermore, when my app is operating, I am looking for consumers’ responses in order to make updates and maintain the program to guarantee that there are no malfunctions or troubles encountered.<br><br>
                  
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="project_text_item">
                <h2>Risk</h2>
                <p>
                  + The way AI works is relied on its data base, which its machine learning process can use against itself. Data poisoning can lead to incorrect information that AI learning, and it can generate false images, video, audio while operating. Another factor that we must consider while running is network connectivity; consumers' phones require a stable internet connection in order to deliver data quickly and accurately. Indeed, a lost or inadequate internet connection might put our customers in risk and degrade their experience. Furthermore, malicious code can be delivered to the organization's system, which will take time to recover from and may affect sensitive data if timely technical action is not taken. Besides that, prior to some important events such as demo day, our company may face cyber-attacks and system malfunctions from both inside and outside our system, so in order to keep everything safe and ready for the critical events, we usually have to back-up, sync files between different servers in case something unfortunate happens. <br><br>

+ Team members' health and other challenges are also significant issues that impede our success. If one of our members is dealing with a health issue or a family business, he or she will be unable to concentrate and fully participate to the project. As a result, this may have an impact on development and quality, both of which take more time, and time is of the essence for a fledgling company. As a start-up, time is the most valuable resources to help us achieve goals and projects for the more time we spend, the more money we will have to consume. <br><br>
