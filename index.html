                <h2>Topic</h2>
                <p>+ Over the last two decades, the world has undergone massive changes; however, there have been few applications or websites developed to assist the disabled. When programmers create a program, they are typically concerned with the profit it will bring, but technology, to me, is a tool for improving people's living conditions. With a strong desire to make the lives of the blind easier, I decided to develop an application with AI support that would act as their second eyes, assisting them in recognizing everything around them. The project will run on both the iOS and Android platforms to reach the greatest number of users possible with the help of virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and so on.<br><br> 
                  + This application not only helps visually impaired persons have a better day-to-day experience, but it also helps to develop essential technologies that will be used in a billion-dollar industry. Working on this project will provide us with a professional working environment in which we will be able to collaborate with experienced professors and create hundreds of works for others.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                   According to the Visual Impairments and Blindness Global Data & Statistics in 2020 there are around 276 million people worldwide are blind or have moderate or serve vision impairment, among them 205 million visually impaired people are over the age of 50, accounting for 80 percent (Laser eye surgery hub - 2020). Above all, my grandfather is having diabetes which can lead to the complication is visual impairment, so I want to create something to help him and others like him enjoy the world around them without any difficulties. Furthermore, the basic AI system on a cell phone has been developed, so all that is required is an application that connects and controls the AI to do far more than ever before. Indeed, AI is playing an important part in the development of numerous technologies around the world, and it has the potential to be a game changer in many industries such as producing autonomous vehicles, the metaverse, and cyber security. Working on this project will provide me with numerous opportunities to approach professional employers, as my knowledge and abilities in AI development are highly valued in today's large organizations. Not only can my skills and expertise attract professional employers, but this community project can also pique their interest in terms of assistance and investment.

                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <p>
                  In the market, there are now many applications and products are developed already: <br><br>
+ The first one is ‘Be my eyes’ which available on both iOS and Android platform. However, this requires volunteers which means it need real person sitting in front of the camera to support people have visual impaired while they are opening the apps. This necessitates a big volunteer workforce, and they must be available at all times to give critical and timely assistance to users.<br><br>
+ The second one is the lumen glasses; this is the most advanced technology to support visual impairments with 5 cameras, it can detect whole surrounding environment and transfer to the users with both haptic and auditory contact. Although these glasses incorporate a lot of advanced technology, I believe the pricing is out of reach for most people.<br><br>
+ The last one and also our direct rival is ‘Seeing AI’ which developed by Microsoft, this is the most similar one to our project, however this is only developed in iOS which cause inconvenience for users who are not using iPhone. Furthermore, this is only used with the iPhone's Voiceover mode, thus they are not genuinely assisted by the virtual assistance, which cannot provide the appropriate decision like human in various instances and cannot also launch and operate the application using voice.

                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <p>Build a perfect recognition system of objects around us: With AI, machine and deep learning; a recognition system of surrounding objects such as texts, currency, color, description of people and scene will be created.<br><br>
                  + Another support tool for visual impairments: Training a guide dog can cost up to 60,000 dollars, and they cannot readily care for the dog on their own; also, using a walking cane for visual impairments is not always convenient or effective. As a result, our program was created to tackle this fundamental issue; it not only saves them money but also improves their daily activities and living conditions (Mihai-Alexandru Cristea - 23/11/2020). This technology required many resources because we are not only aim to make a solution for the visually impaired, but also a best product, a reliable guardian to aid them in daily life which create opportunities for the blind to live independent and live the way they like with less difficulties. People with visually impaired can be support from the app to help them travel without guidance from others and documents, texts and even the amount of money they paid can be read out loud. Beyond that, it has the potential to launch a revolution in technology development for the disabled, ensuring that no one is left behind in the 4.0 era. <br><br>
                  + Chances to enter billions dollar industry in IT field:  If the initiative succeeds, it will earn us a lot of money from users who purchase the software to serve the further research purposes; in fact, many huge syndicates and specialists want to join our community project, giving us the opportunity to work in a professional environment. This is also fundamental experience for us to develop in the AI, censor and lidar cameras, and the virtual assistant’s technology which can support us to come into many other industries such as developing autonomous vehicles, manufacturing robots and education services.  <br><br>
                  •	Autonomous vehicles: Vehicle sensor technology, such as laser radar or LiDAR systems, is expected to be the new cornerstone of self-driving vehicles. Laser radar works in conjunction with other sensors such as cameras, ultrasonic, and long-range radar to assist cars and trucks in navigating their surroundings. (Ann Neal - Apr 24, 2018) <br><br>
                  
                  •	Robots: in assembly applications, AI is a very important tool. When paired with advanced vision systems, AI can aid in real-time course correction, which is especially beneficial in complicated industrial industries such as aerospace. While in operation, AI can also be utilized to assist a robot in learning on its own which paths are optimal for various procedures (Robotics Online Marketing Team | 09/11/2018). <br><br>
                  
                  •	Educational services: Many blind students struggle with their academics; they seldom catch up with classmates, so their phones might serve as trustworthy allies, reading and delivering information and documents for them. Furthermore, as AI advances, virtual technology can be used in class to make the material more specific and intriguing.

                <h2>Plan and progress</h2>
                <p>
                  - Forming a team including project leader, interface and icon designer, front-back end developer and technical developer.<br><br>

- In order create these apps, many professionals in various fields are needed, including mechatronics, robotics, industrial design, psychology, business development, and before publishing the application to the community, it must go through numerous tests with many blind individuals in order to deliver the best version (Mihai-Alexandru Cristea - 23/11/2020). This is a revolutionary creation for the blind, so it forces to make no mistakes during the running process because it might be affected to their experience or even their lives.<br><br> 

- To begin, the app icon will be created by using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The app icon will look like a human face with an eye to indicate the purpose of this application which is the third eye for visual impaired. To ensure that the largest number of users can approach, Android applications must use programming languages such as Java or C++, while iOS apps must use Swift or Object-C. <br><br>

- Unlike other apps, users do not need to click on the app's icon or navigate through the user interface; instead, they will instruct the virtual assistant to turn on and control the app whenever they require it. Making a basic user interface is critical for the majority of my users, who have visual impairments; yet it must also be ensured that it loads quickly and runs smoothly. The application will be pretty basic, with several channels such as currency, text and handwriting, color, and scene surrounding it that can be switched to by both voice and hands.<br><br>

- Using machine learning and deep learning to help AI study from the simplest to the most complicated data and images in order to recognize, analyze, forecast, and provide final findings as quickly as feasible. It has to understand the environment, objects, their position and movement in 3D. To guarantee the system functions efficiently and properly, a good picture classification algorithm is designed, which needs a lot of individual and technological processes between the live camera video stream and data (Oction n.d.). <br><br>

•	To train an artificial intelligence model, you'll need a dataset, which is a collection off hundreds to thousands of sample photos of objects that your artificial intelligence model should be able to recognize (Moses Olafenwa - Jul 20, 2018). Creating a dataset is a hard and time-consuming procedure. It must take a systematic approach to gathering data that may be utilized to create a high-quality dataset and identifying the many data sources that will be used to train the specific model (Gaudenz Boesch - November 17, 2021). In orde to make it recognize anything in images, it traditionally requires a great deal of expertise in Applied Mathematics as well as the use of Deep Learning libraries, and the amount of time and stress involved in writing the code for the algorithm and fitting the code to the images is considerable. Algorithms produce a list of object categories present in the image along with an axis-aligned bounding box indicating the position and scale of every instance of each object category (Jason Brownlee on May 22, 2019).<br><br>

•	Furthermore, handwriting is a crucial aspect and the most difficult part of this project because the handwriting recognition system can be used in many businesses other than those for the blind, such as banking, insurance, and health care. And it takes a lot of effort to create a decent handwriting recognition system that works accurately and quickly. The first approaches to addressing handwriting recognition included Machine Learning methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), SVM, and others. After the initial text is pre-processed, feature extraction is conducted to detect crucial information about an individual character such as loops, inflection points, aspect ratio, and so on. To obtain the results, these created features are passed into a classifier such as HMM. Machine learning models have limited performance; nevertheless, with the advent of deep learning, there has been a significant improvement in the accuracy of handwriting recognition. Deep learning requires a large amount of data to train and obtaining a large corpus of labelled handwriting images for various languages is a time-consuming task. Handwriting Text Generation is the task of generating realistic-looking handwritten text, which can be used to supplement existing datasets.<br><br>

- We won't have to create our own virtual assistant; thus, we'll spend less time on development. Amazon Corporation has well developed Alexa to accomplish many activities, including those in smart homes, so training Alexa to learn information from database sets and then recognize items properly when we apply machine learning, deep learning, and a range of other algorithms is pretty straightforward.<br><br>
- The development of LIDAR sensors on phones will result in faster and more precise assessment of the surrounding environment, resulting in the best user experience possible (Jessica Canning - 26 March 2021). Alexa will be programmed to perform all of the app's functions, such as starting it up and moving between stations. It will also link and activate their front camera to process data from a video stream in a radius of 10 meters in front of them to warn of impending threats and things, and the virtual aid will access the microphone to communicate information to the blind using auditory impulses. Furthermore, it can recognize the color, language, and handwriting in newspapers and documents, as well as the value of the money they paid and human expression.<br><br>
- To handle the input and output data, this will need to build an extensive backend computing, such as massive database management, memory allocation, and powerful hardware interfacing (Kevin Toth - 16 Jan 2017). Big data can be characterized as data sets whose size or type exceeds typical relational databases' capabilities to record, handle, and process the data with minimal latency.<br><br>
- Adding more languages is a challenging task for our application because it affects not only how our virtual assistant speaks out loud in that language, but also how we recognize text or handwriting, which is especially challenging with pictographs such as Chinese, Japanese, and so on, despite the fact that these are potential markets. The software will initially have English audio readout; but, in order to broaden the market, it will be expanded to include many other languages such as Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese.<br><br>

- After completing the app, a demo will be released to gain solicit feedback from friends and family to change or add certain adjustments to produce the most user-friendly platforms. Furthermore, when the app is operating, consumers’ responses will be collected in order to make updates and maintain the program to guarantee that there are no malfunctions or troubles encountered.

                <h2>Roles</h2>
                <p>
                  In this project, specific roles are needed to complete tasks effectively and delivery each features on time: <br><br>
- The position of leader is irreplaceable since he is the one who embraces all of the aspects in the initiatives. He must assign assignments to each team member and ensure that each task is completed on schedule, accurately, and fluently. He is also the one with the most expertise and experience in this business, so he can lead the team and manage problems and conflicts that the employee may encounter.<br><br>
- The importance of UI/UX designers in creating, simplifying and making the app interface easier to work on for visually impaired users cannot be overstated. They are unable to see anything; nonetheless, designers must ensure that all channels in the app are flexible. Furthermore, the interface must connect to the phone's virtual assistance to provide the quickest access, support, and use of the application.<br><br>
- Technical Designer: Technical developer have to be professionals in AI, deep learning, big data analysis and machine learning: This will necessitate a large number of images and videos from many live cameras from all over the world so we can handle all the data in traditional. The computer has to learn and imbrue with the expression, people facial, colour, currency, scene and movements of objects. Furthermore, using the live text function, Virtual assistant can detect and understand the text and handwriting that appears in the camera. So, in order to handle a large volume and variety of data in a fast and accurate way data scientist is very important, they also have experience in big data analytic and machine learning deliver these data to AI, which is an artificial neural network, will train the virtual assistants to absorb and categorize the input or real-time visuals from videos (IBM Cloud Education - 15 Jul 2020). <br><br>

                <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
                <p>We quickly identified three prioritized tasks to complete the applications. After completing those tasks, the apps will be able to perform their primary function: assisting the blinds. The first and most difficult task is to create a computer system that can understand the surrounding environment in 3D. To scan the scenery, it must be computed by image classification algorithms. The blind can identify objects and people around them in this manner. We will spend about 4 to 6 weeks to develop the computer system. For the input/output data when the computer transmits to the auditory impulses of the blind and vice versa, it is necessary to develop the back-end for the system and train the virtual assistant to guide the blind precisely. All smartphone devices are now having their own virtual assistants (i.e., Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa…) so we just have to add some additional commands for the assistant. These two tasks can be completed in 2 to 4 weeks. For the rest of 12 weeks development, we will spend time testing the application on some blind individuals and design the GUI for the most efficient and convenient user experience. </p>

                <h2>Tools and technology</h2>

                <p>
                  - Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence allows the machine to learn from experience, adjust to new data (inputs), and perform tasks that can be performed by humans. Branches of artificial intelligence include machine learning, neuron network, and deep learning.<br><br>
- Machine/ Deep Learning: (Arne Wolfewicz - November 9, 2021)<br><br>
+ Machine learning: is a broad term for when computers learn from data and use algorithms to execute a certain task without being explicitly programmed; instead, it recognizes patterns in the data and makes predictions when new data arrives.<br><br>
+ Deep learning: is basically machine learning, but it comprises Artificial Neural Network algorithms that analyze data with a logic structure that can overcome machine learning's restricted strength. Deep learning is designed to handle enormous amounts of unstructured data before making decisions and delivering info to users.<br><br>
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN): refers to a way of processing information or a collection of computer systems It is made up of several interconnected neurons that work together to fulfil specific tasks, and it is designed to process information in the same manner that human and animal brains do.<br><br>
- Big data: This application will require a great number of videos and images for the computer to learn and imbue with the emotion, color, and movements of objects, thus we must deal with the large volume and intricacy of these data. Public dataset generally available online, are open-source, and free to use, share and modify by anyone.<br><br>
- Alexa: Amazon has built Alexa to operate numerous influential apps such as Tiktok, Twitter, and so on. Amazon is working on a new feature for its Alexa voice assistant that will allow the program to open Android and iOS apps using voice commands. As a result, we can employ deep learning techniques to enable Alexa to respond to your voice and learn about your preferences.<br><br>

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>Testing is an indispensable aspect of any project, and in order to succeed, we must test any features that have been built on a regular basis. After developing each feature, we must test it to ensure that when everything is combined into a complete program, it will function without errors. Many volunteers, including impaired and impaired people, are welcome to participate in our testing project in order to completely judge and feel about it. They will be the ones who uncover our mistakes while the app is running, as well as inconvenient features that the app contains, and they will be the ones who make improvements to fit their needs the best. To have the finest testing environment to judge the project precisely, perhaps a field test with many moving objects, paper with texts and handwriting needs to be made. Many professionals in various fields, such as mechatronics, robotics, industrial design, psychology, and business development, are required to support and finish this project. Because this is a breakthrough creation for the blind, any faults made during the running process may have an impact on their experience or even their life.</p>

                <h2>Risk</h2>
                <p>
                  + The way AI works is relied on its data base, which its machine learning process can use against itself. Data poisoning can lead to incorrect information that AI learning, and it can generate false images, video, audio while operating. Another factor that we must consider while running is network connectivity; consumers' phones require a stable internet connection in order to deliver data quickly and accurately. Indeed, a lost or inadequate internet connection might put our customers in risk and degrade their experience. Furthermore, malicious code can be delivered to the organization's system, which will take time to recover from and may affect sensitive data if timely technical action is not taken. Besides that, prior to some important events such as demo day, our company may face cyber-attacks and system malfunctions from both inside and outside our system, so in order to keep everything safe and ready for the critical events, we usually have to back-up, sync files between different servers in case something unfortunate happens. <br><br>

+ Team members' health and other challenges are also significant issues that impede our success. If one of our members is dealing with a health issue or a family business, he or she will be unable to concentrate and fully participate to the project. As a result, this may have an impact on development and quality, both of which take more time, and time is of the essence for a fledgling company. As a start-up, time is the most valuable resources to help us achieve goals and projects for the more time we spend, the more money we will have to consume. <br><br>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>As is customary in Vietnam, we exchange our Facebook contacts first and then create a Messenger group for better content sharing and task division discussion. Twice a week, we'll get together. After the IT Tutorial on Thursday afternoon, we'll walk to the 8th floor and have a Face-to-Face meeting in the Student Hub. On Saturday evening, we'll have another meeting where we'll communicate via Discord, which is similar to Skype but has more features. We'll go through the week's work and revisions, as well as the plan for the following week. If a teammate fails to interact with the team, we shall attempt to contact him/her as quickly as possible via Facebook, email, or phone. If the foregoing attempts failed multiple times, we would have to grudgingly report that teammate.</p>

                <p>We believe that almost all of our team members are still doing well till our last assignment; we always observe other positive energy, and no one appears to be fatigued while performing their duties. Indeed, we are really supportive of one another in this assignment; if we meet an issue, we will all discuss how to solve it, and we are also brainstorming a lot of new ideas for our website and presentation slides. The majority of things went well and smoothly during our procedure because we gained more experience and improved as a result of assignment 2 and lecturer feedback. However, despite rigorous preparation, we are unable to deliver our presentation to the audience smoothly. We believe we were palpitating because this was our first presentation part together, and after working together for a long time, we are optimistic that we can develop and perform better in the next one. </p>

      <p>+ Minh Duc surprised me, despite the fact that I knew he was competent at using Adobe Illustrator to sketch things and make videos. However, when he mentioned he would conduct the presentation section in our group, he utterly stunned me because he drew everything himself, without utilizing any template or ideas from the internet. He drew by hand based on the idea I gave him, adding additional effects to make it incredibly vibrant.  <br><br>
        + I've learned a lot while I've been working in this group, notably about the dedication of my team members. The most significant thing I've learned from Hung is web programming. He had some experience from secondary and high school, therefore he encouraged us to create a website with great aesthetic. Furthermore, I have learnt creativity from Minh Duc, who has created beautiful presentation slides by drawing on his own. Although each of us had distinct responsibilities in the tasks, we were able to gain a lot from this collaboration assignment, such as communication, responsibility, and critical thinking.

        <p>My instructor, Mr.Ushik,  impressed me with his enthusiasm; he was always willing to answer my questions and even provide us some suggestions that was beneficial for my homework. This completely changed my first impression of university and encouraged me to devote more time to my studies, which I had previously dismissed as tedious. Furthermore, Minh Duc, a member of our team with a remarkable flair for design, performed well on his role of preparing for the presentation. It's difficult to find another IT freshmen who can create all the presentation and effects by hand and without using templates from the Internet. Cao Son and The Duc were also trustworthy and always completed their jobs on schedule. In summary, I consider myself fortunate to be able to learn with a fantastic teacher and great colleagues. <br><br>
          There are many things I've learnt during the course, but the most significant skill I've gained is the ability to operate as part of a group. When working in a group, a considerable quantity of labor may be split among the members, and team members can cover for or compensate for each other's shortcomings. As a result, when compared to individual labor, the outcome is far superior. Furthermore, when I originally started the course, I just had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. However, after spending time studying resources and gaining experience, I believe I am better equipped to build the website's interface and make it appealing to average consumers. I'm hoping that in a subsequent course, I'll be able to gain more information about web programming, as I'm quite interested in it.

      <p>Our project is to develop an application that can help the blind or those with visual impairments. I'm excited to use my imagination to bring this project to life. As I was in charge of designing the GUI and simplifying functions, I had to consider how users would react to the app's interface. My teammates had faith in my design abilities, so this field went surprisingly well. We spent about 5 days designing the entire GUI as well as the application's icon. We also redesigned our website with Hung Nguyen using GitHub. Every Saturday evening, we gathered in Discord to plan out what we would do to make our website more beautiful and informative. Aside from what we could contribute to this project easily, we also had some aspects to improve. We got stuck in the timeframe for 1 week since we had to calculate everything in detail and minimized some steps to arrange the works for each week. Our application is built on an AI system so this required so many tasks. Luckily, in week 12, we got the Timeframe finished to move on. Throughout two projects, we engaged better in problem-solving and innovating. I’m glad to work with my teammates since they all have their will to rescue a member encountering a hard task.</p>        </div>

              <p>Writing reflections following each assignment, in my opinion, can significantly help us improve. As such, this paper will discuss my role in the third assignment of this course, Intro to IT. Our team consists of four members, all of whom have performed admirably. They are also talented in several aspects, especially Hung's computing skills and Duc Duong's painting and design skills. After the Christmas break, we began our assignment by splitting work. Hung was in charge of the team's website and Git respiratory, while Duc Duong was in charge of the icon and interface design for the application. Meanwhile, I and Son are in charge of the majority of the project descriptions. Reflecting on my roles as "researcher" and "observer," I feel that both positions were ideal for me since I would love to offer feedback on our group's presentation about how our application should perform. Everything went smoothly until we ran into some difficulties fitting the timeline around our plans and development. This occurred during an exam in a different course: Introduction to Computer Systems and Platform Technologies. Fortunately, Son has proposed some rather interesting suggestions via a Discord chat. By omitting some complicated processes and altering some specifics, we are able to execute those two tasks together. I'm relieved to have joined a team with my partner because they're really good at maintaining their composure when problem-solving and resolving other problems during brainstorming.</p>
